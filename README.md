# -Research-Report-on-Social-Engineering-Attacks

Abstract
Social engineering attacks take advantage of human psychology to get around technical defenses, threat of which phishing, pretexting, and baiting are posing to organizations and individuals. The document evaluates scholarly literature, industry reports, and case studies in order to understand the attacks' mechanisms, trends, and countermeasures, revealing gaps in awareness training as well as necessity for integrated frameworks such as NIST. Main findings show a rise in social engineering incidents, accounting for 36-39% of breaches in 2025, thus highlighting the need for stronger human-centered protections.

Introduction
Social engineering has been and continues to be a big challenge for cybersecurity since it attacks the human part and frequently makes even the most sophisticated technical defenses useless. The threats of such a nature have gone up, and during the first part of the year 2025, social engineering will be responsible for 39% of the initial access incidents due to the use of AI in deception among others. This report will look into phishing, pretexting, and baiting attacks with the goal of analyzing their modes of operations, effects and the countermeasures through evidence-based reasoning.

Literature Review
Current studies describe social engineering as deceptive means of psychologically manipulating persons to gain illegal access and it includes phishing (false emails), pretexting (pretended situations), and baiting (attractive media with malware). Researchers emphasize strategies that are based on persuasion techniques like authority, urgency, and reciprocity, which come from social psychology. There are still deficiencies in incorporating behavioral sciences into protections; awareness campaigns usually do not consider non-phishing methods, and there is a shortage of quantitative assessments of training effectiveness.

Methodology
This analytical review of qualitative nature combines data from peer-reviewed journals, conference papers, and cybersecurity reports obtained through web searches on academic databases and industry resources. Among the sources are case studies for the years 2010-2025, the NIST frameworks, and threat reports from Proofpoint and Unit 42. Information was thematically analyzed by categorizing attack steps, psychological tactics, trends, and countermeasures, ensuring the availability of URL citations for replicability.

Results
Phishing is a practice that consists of sending deceptive emails that imitate the looks of reliable organizations in order to deceive people into opening links or attachments, which eventually results in the downloading of malware or theft of user credentials; the process of phishing includes the creation of the bait, its delivery and later exploitation. Meanwhile, pretexting is used to build false trust through impersonation first, then the sensitive data is demanded from the user, as it happened in the 2006 HP scandal when investigators were able to illegally access the phone records. In baiting, infected USBs or files are offered as "freebies" in public places which can be easily accessed, and it was done by Stuxnet which dropped the USBs at the Iranian nuclear facilities in 2010.
Projections forecasted that social engineering would rise threefold in 2025, whereas the non-phishing tactics like fake CAPTCHAs would increase a staggering 1,450%. The real-life examples give us an idea about the degree of the issue: Google and Facebook lost together $100M due to fake invoices (2013-2015), 100,000 patients' data being exposed by Elara Caring, and Ubiquiti's $46.7M fraud loss.
The psychological techniques used in the attacks include curiosity, greed and authority as their main factors.

Discussion

The findings show that social engineering is the king of the hill security threats. This method easily bypasses technical controls and leads to organizations losing massive amounts of money and even stopping their operations, like in the case of Colonial Pipeline. Measures to fight back such as NIST's awareness training and simulated phishing are indeed useful but suffer from employee tiredness and AI tactics that are getting more sophisticated. The lack of real-time detection and psychological inoculation underlines the necessity for gamified, continuous programs.

Conclusion

Social engineering, particularly phishing, pretexting, and baiting, takes advantage of the inherent human weaknesses and, therefore, it is necessary to have multifaceted defenses where technology is just part of the solution. The practical implications of this are that the awareness policies will be mandatory and NIST-aligned incident response will have to be implemented in order to build up resilience. The future studies should investigate the use of AI-powered simulations and the effect of long-term training.
